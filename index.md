#### How I Approached the Project
- Importation of the data and libraries
- Preprocessed the data and carried out exploratory data analysis (categorized the products with machine learning algorithm)
- Analyzed the product range 
   - Revenue analyses
   - Products more often sold by themselves
   - Products in additional assortment
   - Product categories more often in additional assortment
   - Product categories often present in shopping carts
- Formulated and tested statistical hypotheses
- Conclusion and recommendations

#### Recommendations
- Since about 99.7% of products are included in additional assortment, there is a need to create a product recommendation system.
- Home decorations is the third most purchased category but has the highest average revenue. Hence, invest more in advertising home decorations to boost purchase rate and revenue.
- As plant and accessories is the least frequently purchased category, increase advertising investment to enhance orders.
- Regency cakestand 3 tier is the leading revenue generator on aggragate but the most cancelled product order. Pay much attention to this product. For instance, why does it often get cancelled? If the cancellation rate is minimized, revenue would be maximized.
