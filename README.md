|In 2019, there were about 1.92 billion digital buyers across the world economy. This means e-commerce is growing rapidly. As e-commerce continues to thrive, traditional brick and mortar establishments are modifying and digitalizing their business models to keep up to or beat competitions. This has increased competition in the e-commerce industry. To enhance marketing, optimize prices, to deeply understand customer expectations, etc, demands analytics. As a junior analyst at an online store that sells household goods, my task is to analyze the store's product range between 29/11/2018 and 07/12/2019.  | *Pandas*, *Matplotlib.pyplot*, *Plotly*, *Seaborn*, *Numpy*, *Scipy*, *Scikit-learn*, *Scikit-plot*, *Itertools*, *Collections* | Practicum by Yandex |
